## Setup GAS Enhanced Input Mapping

Open the *Input Action* created add a trigger, set it to *Down* <Step text="1"/> and make sure the *Actuation Threshold* is equal to *zero* <Step text="2"/>.

Open *Input Mapping Context* and add action mapping <Step text="1"/>, select the *Input Action* that was created earlier <Step text="2"/>. After that you need to bind this *Input Action* to a key <Step text="3"/> as shown in the image below.

Now open *GAS Enhanced Input Mapping*, first set the `Input Mapping Context`, that was created earlier, to it's specific variable <Step text="1"/>, then click on *+* to add *Ability Mapping*.
Select the `Input Action` as in <Step text="2"/>, after that set `TBIA.Input.Interaction.InteractActive` as a gameplay tag <Step text="3"/> that links *GAInteractActive* to the selected *Input Action*. Lastly set `GAInterActive` ability as in <Step text="4"/>.

## Setup Player Character

Open `Player Character` select *TBIA_Interaction Component* , go to *Details panel* and under `TwistedBytes | Interaction | Config` set *Input Consumer* <Step text="2"/> to `TBIA Enhanced Input Component` Lastly set `GAS Enhanced Input Mapping` as in <Step text="3"/>.

## Setup Custom Abilities

In order to add new abilities and bind them to specific actions like *GA_Run* that we have in the demo project, 
Open *GAS Enhanced Input Mapping* as you can see on <Step text="1"/> this input tag is already added to the
 `Interact Active Ability's CDO`. This means that when you add a new mapping for *GA_Run* and after setting the *Input Action*
 and the *Gameplay Ability*, the input tag you set like in <Step text="2"/> should be also added to *GA_Run* in the 
*Ability Tags* <Step text="3"/> as shown in the image below.
