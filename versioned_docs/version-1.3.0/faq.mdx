## Question 1

 Q: Do you offer the source code with the plugin ?

 A: Yes of course, the plugin comes with full source code once you buy it from the MarketPlace.

## Question 2

Q: Are there any tick events in interactable objects? Will it affect performance if I have 1000+ of interactable objects in my level ?

A:  Interactable objects never tick. They only execute logic when being interacted with which is very performant. Additionally, we will make tutorials on how to use light-weight instances with our plugin.

## Question 3

Q: Does it also work when 2 objects are very close (almost overlapping) ?

A: Interactables are detected by executing a line trace which will return only one object at a time.

## Question 4

Q: Is there any reason to buy this product when there are similar ones, but free? What is the selling feature of this plugin compared to the free ones ?

A: As stated in the plugin description, one of the main features is multiplayer support with client-prediction. Also, our plugin extends GAS by adding support for replicated montages on multiple skeletal meshes.

## Question 5

Q: Triggered interactions are not visible / get out of sync.

A: Make sure that `Replicates` is set to `true` in the respective actor's CDO.

## Question 6

Q: My proximity interactions are not working properly.

A: Multiple issues might cause proximity interactions to fail:
  * Make sure that your interactable actor object type is the same as the object type you are tracing for in the proximity settings.
  * Check if your actor have `TBIA_Interactable` interface.
  * Make sure that the object interaction priority settings are correct.

## Question 7

Q: *On Interactable Target Found* event is not being called.

A: Multiple issues might cause to this:
  * Check if `IsAvailableForInteraction` interface function is overridden and returns true.
  * Make sure that `IsBlockedForInteraction` interface function is overridden and returns false.
  * Lastly see if `IsInteractionStilValid` interface function is overridden and returns true.
