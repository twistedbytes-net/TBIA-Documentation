## Setting up player character

To get started, create a new project based on Unreal Engine's *Third Person Template*.

Open the `ThirdPersonCharacter` Blueprint and go to *Class Settings* <Step text="1"/>.
Change the *Parent Class* <Step text="2"/> from `Character` to `TBIA_GASCharacter`.
After changing the *Parent Class*, two new components `TBIA Interaction Component` and
`TBIA Ability System Component` will appear <Step text="3"/>.

Also note that your Character Blueprint now inherits two interfaces <Step text="4"/>
`Ability System Interface` and `TBIA Interactable` that we will make use of in a moment.

For a better third-person perspective move the camera's location a bit to the side, e.g.
`(0.0, 80.0, 60.0)` <Step text="1"/>.

![Character Camera](_static/img/passive/05_character_camera.png)

Next, create a socket on the head bone <Step text="1"/> and name it
`headSocket` <Step text="2"/>. Keep the location at its default.

## Create Interact Passive Ability

To create an *Interact Passive* ability, right-click in the *Content Browser* and
select `TwistedBytes | Abilities | Interact Passive` as shown in <Step text="1"/>.

Name the newly created asset `InteractPassive`.

![Create Interact Passive Ability](_static/img/passive/02_create_passive.png)

Open your newly created `InteractPassive` Blueprint and change the *Trace Channel* property to your
own *Collision Channel*, e.g. `Interactable` <Step text="1"/> (see [Migration Guide](../getting-started/migration-guide#collision-settings)).

Set `Trace Start Location Type` to `Socket on Character's Mesh` <Step text="2"/>.

For easier debugging of our *Interact Passive Ability* we also want to enable `Show Debug` <Step text="3"/>.

:::note
The max interaction range defaults to 3 meters. For this example, the default value will work just fine.
:::

Press *Play* in the Unreal Editor. You should now see a debug line trace that starts from your character's head
as shown in the image below which means your *Interact Passive Ability* is set up correctly.

## Create your first interactable object

To create your first interactable object, right-click in the *Content Browser* and select
`TwistedBytes | Actors | GAS Actor Base` <Step text="1"/>.

![Create GAS Actor](_static/img/passive/08_create_gas_actor.png)

Open the newly created Actor Blueprint and add a *Static Mesh Component*. Make this component the default root
component by dragging and dropping it onto `DefaultSceneRoot` as shown in the image below.

![Set Mesh](_static/img/passive/09_set_mesh.png)

Select the `StaticMesh` in the *Components* tab. Then, in the *Details* tab, assign `1M_Cube_Chamfer` to the
`Static Mesh` property <Step text="1"/> and lower its scale to `0.25` for all three axis <Step text="2"/>.

![Mesh Settings](_static/img/passive/10_mesh_settings.png)

In the `My Blueprint` tab in the lower-left, expand the `TwistedBytes` interface functions and override
`On Interactable Target Found` <Step text="1"/> and `On Interactable Target Lost` <Step text="2"/>.

Add `Print String` nodes to print some debug information about interactable actors as shown in the *Event Graph* in
the image below.

![Target Found and Target Lost events](_static/img/passive/11_target_found_lost.png)

This concludes the initial set up of our interactable cube. Now, place one or more instances of it in the level and
then let's test our implementation. Press *Play* in the Unreal Editor.

:::note
Remember that we did not modify the max range for interactions in our `PassiveAbility` Blueprint.
This means we can only interact within 3 meters between the player character and an interactable object.
:::

Walk up to an interactable cube so that the player character is in range for interactions.
You should now see debug messages being printed whenever you look at the cube.

![Target Found event](_static/img/passive/12_target_found.png)

When you look away from the cube the `On Interactable Target Lost` event will be triggered. You should see
debug messages as shown in the image below.

![Target Lost event](_static/img/passive/13_target_lost.png)

## Extending Passive Ability Functionality

Open the Blueprint of our interactable test cube (`GASActorBase`) again. In the interface functions,
override `Is Available for Interaction`. Add a `Print String` node as shown in  <Step text="1"/> and
set the `Return Value` to `true` <Step text="2"/>.

Now press *Play* in the Unreal Editor and see what will happen when you try to interact with our test cube.

![Available true](_static/img/passive/14_available.png)

As you can see the `Is Available for Interaction` interface function <Step text="1"/> was called
before the `On Interactable Target Found` event was fired <Step text="2"/>. This is because the
`Interact Passive` ability periodically executes a line trace to check for potential interactable objects
in view and range.

If an interactable actor (i.e. an actor implementing the `TBIA_Interactable` interface) has been found,
the passive ability will first call `Is Available for Interaction` <Step text="3"/> to determine whether this
interactable actor is currently available for interactions or not. Only if the interactable is indeed available,
the `On Interactable Target Found` event will be fired in order to notify all potential interactors.

![Available true in-game](_static/img/passive/15_available_ingame.png)

Let's set the return value of `Is Available For Interaction` to ``false` <Step text="1"/> and then
press *Play* again.

![Available false](_static/img/passive/16_available_false.png)

The debug messages show that only the `Is Available For Interaction` interface function is now being
called <Step text="1"/> and that the `On Interactable Target Found` event is not triggered at all.

This is because our implementation for the test cube now always answers *"No, I'm not available at the moment"*
whenever our passive ability asks for the cube's current availability status.
